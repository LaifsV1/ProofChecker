Theorem [transitivity A to C]:
    Statement: A => C
    Proof:
        assume [A] : A .
        we know [B] : B because [A to B] with ([A]).
        we know [C] : C because [B to C] with ([B]).

    QED.

Definitions:
    [DNE]  : ((A => Falsity) => Falsity) => A;

Theorem [DNE of C]:
    Statement: ((C => Falsity) => Falsity) => C
    Proof:
        we get [C] : ((C => Falsity) => Falsity) => C instantiating [DNE] with (A is C).
